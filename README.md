# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Project Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard, a company with several thousand employees, for the upcoming “silver tsunami”. A large number of employees will begin retiring at a rapid rate in the next few years and the company wants to be prepared with the retirement packages, open positions and employees’ training. In order to ensure a smooth transition this analysis focuses on the following:

1. Identify the retiring employees by their title.
2. Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
3. Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program.
4. Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department.
5. Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation grouped by title and department.
